Task 6: Luhn Algorithm (Credit Card Validation)

This task implements the **Luhn algorithm**, which is widely used to validate credit/debit card numbers.

## Steps:
1. The program takes input of a card number (with or without spaces/dashes).
2. It removes all spaces and dashes, then reverses the string.
3. Two sums are calculated:
   - **Odd digits**: Directly summed.
   - **Even digits**: Doubled; if the result is greater than 9, subtract 9.
4. The total sum is checked:
   - If divisible by 10 → The card number is **Valid**.
   - Otherwise → The card number is **Not Valid**.
