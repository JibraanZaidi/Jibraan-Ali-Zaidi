Task 9 – BFS Traversal of Tree

Description:
This task demonstrates Breadth First Search (BFS) traversal of a binary tree. Unlike DFS which goes deep first, BFS explores nodes level by level.

Tree Structure:

        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7


Code Explanation:

The tree is represented as an adjacency list (dictionary).

A BFS function is implemented recursively.

It takes the current level’s nodes, visits them, and prepares the list for the next level.

The process continues until all levels are traversed.

Key Points of BFS:

Visits all nodes at depth d before moving to depth d+1.

Useful in shortest path algorithms and AI search problems.

Example Output:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7
