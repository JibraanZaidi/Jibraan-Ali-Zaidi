Task 9 â€“ BFS Traversal (Queue Implementation)

Description:
This task demonstrates Breadth First Search (BFS) traversal using a queue data structure.
Unlike recursive BFS, here nodes are stored in a queue and processed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.

Tree Structure:

        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7


Working of the Code:

Start with the root node "1".

Add it to the visited list and queue.

While the queue is not empty:

Dequeue the first element.

Print it (visit).

Enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.

Repeat until the queue becomes empty.

Example Output:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7
