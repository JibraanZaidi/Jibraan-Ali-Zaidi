Task 7: Model-Based Reflex Agent

This task demonstrates a **Model-Based Reflex Agent** that controls a heater depending on the room temperature compared to a demanding (desired) temperature.  
It also remembers the **previous action** to avoid unnecessary changes.

## Features:
- Reads the demanding temperature (e.g., 22°C).
- Compares the **current room temperature** with the demanding temperature.
- Actions:
  - If room temperature < demanding temperature → **Heater ON**
  - If room temperature ≥ demanding temperature → **Heater OFF**
- Uses a file (`previous_action.txt`) to store and recall the last action.
- If the action is the same as the previous one, it maintains the state with a message:
  > "There will be no change and maintain the previous action"

## Example:
### Input:
```python
rooms = {
    "Class Room": 20,
    "Auditorium": 22,
    "Office": 25,
    "Common Room": 19,
    "Main Department": 22,
    "Admission Office": 22
}

agent = ModelBasedReflexAgent(22)

for room, temp in rooms.items():
    agent.Sensor(temp)
    print(room, ":", end=" ")
    agent.Actuator()
